# Instagram Photo Downloader

This Python application downloads a photo from an Instagram post. It takes the URL of the post as input and saves the photo as a JPG file.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the app, run the following command:

This will launch the app in your default web browser. You'll see a text input where you can paste the URL of the Instagram post you want to download. After you've entered the URL, click the "Download Photo" button to download the photo.

The app will display the downloaded photo on the web page and provide a "Download file" button that you can use to save the photo to your local disk.
